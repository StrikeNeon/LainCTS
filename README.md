# LainCTS
LainChan Thread Simulator (resource download\thread archival and tts read)
Now with a TUI!
After running the screen you need to select the board, then you scan the board catalog, then the thread.
Then you will be able to to download thread resources (pics, pdfs), archive the thread in .txt form, and have the tts read the thread.
Also, there is now a webcrwler prototype that's supposed to check all possible -chan links and filter out sit - on domains(why)
